here are the tools that make my workflow smooth and keep me productive.

## development

**editor:** vscode with a carefully curated set of extensions
**terminal:** iterm2 with oh-my-zsh
**git client:** mostly command line, sometimes tower for complex merges
**api testing:** postman for quick tests, insomnia for more complex workflows

## design

**ui design:** figma for everything interface-related
**graphics:** affinity designer for logos and illustrations
**prototyping:** figma again, sometimes framer for complex interactions

## productivity

**notes:** obsidian for everything, apple notes for quick captures
**todo:** things 3 - simple, clean, and just works
**calendar:** calendar.app synced across all devices
**focus:** freedom to block distracting websites

## communication

**team chat:** slack during work hours
**email:** mail.app with custom shortcuts
**video calls:** zoom for work, facetime for personal

these tools change over time, but this setup has been pretty stable for the past year.
