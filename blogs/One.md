## Hey Everyone

I am [Durga Prasad](https://x.com/obito_twt/). I do code, read few books and have a sip of chai(mandatory).

Yesterday (31st may) in the afternoon I just wanted to have a place to dump up my thoughts so did spend some time and built this [thoughts.durgaprasad.dev](https://thoughts.durgaprasad.dev) cz why not (haha I have only that domain ðŸ˜‚).

So life lately is going on just like that nothing exicting a very normal life. Here's how my routine looks like :

- wake up
- have a great breakfast( the best part of my day ðŸ˜­)
- get ready and leave to office (it takes around 30 mins for me)
- work there and reach by 6:45
- Get ready and go hit the gym
  - this makes my day tbh i feel more alive here
- reach and have my dinner and start working for around 2-3h on personal projects

So days are passing like this it's like 3 months passed just like that in a blinkðŸ« . Now I am getting my shitty schedule fixed and working on myself and reflecting on my decisions and taking things slowly and getting better day by day.

| Glossy surfaces reflect much more than they reveal.

I do have so many things to fix I am just hoping the things to get better.

For the next six months I am going to commit myself and work on my skills and get really better. And these are few things I am gonna try to achieve:

1. A better job
2. Getting in shape
3. Fix my daily schedule and sleep schedule too.
4. Get something really special for my mom ( she deserves every bit of it.)

Also it's now around 1:08 am hanging around thoughts. Anyways I can write it down here hehe.

See you sooon :)
