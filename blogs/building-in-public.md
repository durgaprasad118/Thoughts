decided to start building in public. sharing the process, the wins, and definitely the failures.

## why build in public?

there's something powerful about working transparently. it keeps you accountable, helps you connect with others, and often leads to unexpected opportunities.

**the benefits:**
- accountability - harder to quit when people are watching
- feedback - get input early and often
- community - find others working on similar things
- learning - teach by doing, learn by sharing

## what i'm building

currently working on a few projects:
- this blog (obviously)
- a productivity app
- some open source tools

## the plan

going to document the journey here. the good, the bad, and the messy middle parts.

follow along if you're interested in the behind-the-scenes of building stuff.

let's see where this goes!
